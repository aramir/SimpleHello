## Simple Hello

> "A simple 'hello' could lead to a million things"

Basic extension that adds `Hello <FirstName>,` string in the beginning of each new or replied-to message. No configuration or settings, the message is hardcoded in. 

The extension is smart enough to handle both plain-text and HTML modes as well as variable and fixed width HTML styles.

> Note: this extension *will not* react to address bar changes after the reply message is loaded/created.
